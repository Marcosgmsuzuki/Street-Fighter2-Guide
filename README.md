# street-fighter2-guide
This is my first personal project using basics foundations of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

I had the idea of ​​creating a guide with a list of moves, of characters from street fighter 2. On the index/home page I made it so that only the characters appear and when clicking on the selected character the page will go to the page that will show the move list
